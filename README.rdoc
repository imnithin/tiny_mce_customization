Had started to blog initially http://imnithin.weebly.com/ and now getting it onto Git.

Please feel free to pull and customize tinymce editor version 4, on Rails 4.

As I have played around with TinyMce editor for my previous project, I would like to share things I did, Afterall sharing is caring hahaha :)

I have added Menu button, menu items that has sub-menu items, a list box in it. 

I will be adding simple image upload and usage in editor as well(using a browser window)
