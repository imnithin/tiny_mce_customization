Had started to blog initially http://imnithin.weebly.com/ and now getting it onto Git.

Please feel free to pull and customize tinymce editor version 4, on Rails 4.

As I have played around with TinyMce editor for my previous project, I would like to share things I did, Afterall sharing is caring ;)

I have added Menu button, menu items that has sub-menu items, a list box as well, and Radio buttons are not supported in TinyMce. 

Image Upload and usage using https://github.com/PerfectlyNormal/tinymce-rails-imageupload thanks a ton to PerfectlyNormal!
